  <div class="basic_know">
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ What Is the Stock Market ? </ul></b>  The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold. Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces that operate under a defined set  of regulations. <br><br> Both “stock market” and “stock exchange” are often used interchangeably. Traders in the stock market buy or sell  shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that are part of the overall stock market. The leading U.S.  stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.
    <br> <br> <br>  
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ How Stock Markets Are Regulated ? </ul></b> Most nations have a stock market, and each is regulated by a local financial regulator or monetary authority, or institute. <br><br> The SEC is the regulatory body charged with overseeing the U.S. stock market. The SEC is a federal agency that works independently  of the government and without political pressure. The mission of the SEC is stated as “protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly,  and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.” <br><br> Companies listed on the stock market exchanges are regulated, and their dealings  are monitored by the SEC. In addition, the exchanges set certain requirements such as mandating timely filing of quarterly financial reports 
                                                                            and instant reporting of relevant corporate developments, to ensure that all market participants are equally informed.Failure to adhere to the regulations can lead to suspension of trading and other disciplinary measures.
   <br> <br> <br>
         <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ What Is the Forex Market ? </ul></b>  The foreign exchange market is where currencies are traded. Currencies are important because they allow us to purchase goods and services locally and across borders. International currencies need to be exchanged to conduct foreign trade and business. <br> <br>
                                                  If you are living in the United States and want to buy cheese from France, then either you or the company from which you buy the cheese has to pay the French for the cheese in euros (EUR). This means that the U.S. importer would have to exchange the equivalent value of U.S. dollars (USD) for euros. <br> <br>
                                                  The same goes for traveling. A French tourist in Egypt can’t pay in euros to see the pyramids because it’s not the locally accepted currency. The tourist has to exchange the euros for the local currency, in this case the Egyptian pound, at the current exchange rate.
   <br> <br> <br>
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ Uses of the Forex Markets : </ul></b>  Companies doing business in foreign countries are at risk due to fluctuations in currency values when they buy or sell goods and services outside of their domestic market. Foreign exchange markets provide a way to hedge currency risk by fixing a rate at which the transaction will be completed. <br><br>
                                                  Imagine a trader who expects interest rates to rise in the United States compared to Australia while the exchange rate between the two currencies (AUD/USD) is 0.71 (i.e., it takes $0.71 USD to buy $1.00 AUD). The trader believes higher U.S. interest rates will increase demand for USD, and the AUD/USD exchange rate therefore will fall because it will require fewer, stronger USDs to buy an AUD. <br><br>
                                                  Factors like interest rates, trade flows, tourism, economic strength, and geopolitical risk affect the supply and demand for currencies, creating daily volatility in the forex markets. An opportunity exists to profit from changes that may increase or reduce one currency’s value compared to another. A forecast that one currency will weaken is essentially the same as assuming that the other currency in the pair will strengthen because currencies are traded as pairs. <br><br>
   <br> <br> <br>
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ What Is Cryptocurrency ?  </ul></b>  A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. <br><br>
                                                  A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. <br><br>
   <br> <br> <br>
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ Types of Cryptocurrency : </ul></b>  Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's ether was designed to be used as payment for validation work done on the blockchain. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. Ripple's XRP is designed to be used by banks to facilitate transfers between different geographies. <br><br>

Ripple's XRP is designed to be used by banks to facilitate transfers between different geographies.
   <br> <br> <br>
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ What Is a Bond ?  </ul></b>  When you purchase a stock, you're buying a microscopic stake in the company. It's yours and you get to share in the growth and also in the loss. On the other hand, a bond is a type of loan. When a company needs funds for any number of reasons, they may issue a bond to finance that loan. Much like a home mortgage, they ask for a certain amount of money for a fixed period of time. When that time is up, the company repays the bond in full. During that time the company pays the investor a set amount of interest, called the coupon, on set dates (often quarterly). <br><br>
                                            The main types of bonds are: <br><br>
                                            1. Government <br>
                                            2. Corporate <br>
                                            3. Municipal <br>
                                            4. Mortgage <br>
                                            5. Treasury <br>
                                           <br><br>Government bonds are generally the safest, while some corporate bonds are considered the most risky of the commonly known bond types. <br> <br>
                                            For investors, the biggest risks are credit risk and interest rate risk. Since bonds are debts, if the issuer fails to pay back their debt, the bond can default. As a result, the riskier the issuer, the higher the interest rate will be demanded on the bond (and the greater the cost to the borrower). Also, since bonds vary in price opposite interest rates, if rates rise bond values fall.
    <br><br><br>
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ What Is a Commodity? </ul></b> A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. A commodity thus usually refers to a raw material used to manufacture finished goods. A product, on the other hand, is the finished good sold to consumers. <br><br>
                                                The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When they are traded on an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards. 

    <br><br><br>
        <b> <ul style="color: white;">⚪ What Are Mutual Funds ? </ul></b> A mutual fund is an investment company that takes money from many investors and pools it together in one large pot. The professional manager for the fund invests the money in different types of assets including stocks, bonds, commodities, and even real estate. An investor buys shares in the mutual fund. These shares represent an ownership interest in a portion of the assets owned by the fund. Mutual funds are designed for longer-term investors and are not meant to be traded frequently due to their fee structures. <br><br>
                                          Mutual funds are often attractive to investors because they are widely diversified. Diversification helps to minimize risk to an investment. Rather than having to research and make an individual decision as to each type of asset to include in a portfolio, mutual funds offer a single comprehensive investment vehicle. Some mutual funds can have thousands of different holdings. Mutual funds are also very liquid. It is easy to buy and redeem shares in mutual funds. <br><br>
                                          There is a wide variety of mutual funds to consider. A few of the major fund types are bond funds, stock funds, balanced funds, and index funds. <br><br>
                                          The mechanics of trading mutual funds are different from those of ETFs and stocks. Mutual funds require minimum investments of anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000, unlike stocks and ETFs where the minimum investment is one share. Mutual funds trade only once a day after the markets close. Stocks and ETFs can be traded at any point during the trading day. <br><br>
